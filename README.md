## About
EmoJeneration uses Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to classify a tweet into an age group constructed around generational boundaries. The model is trained and tested on tweets that include emojis to investigate the different meanings that emojis may hold for each generation. 

## Results
Our results indicate that there is not enough variation between the way each generation tweets to create a reliable prediction model. We are currently investigating this - and there will be updates soon!
